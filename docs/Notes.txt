===================
Working with forms
===================

<form> element acts like a container for all the form fields.

All the form elements are going to appear inside the form tags ex:
<form id=''>
<input name='' type=''>
</form>

It's not a good pratice to put a input outside the form.

action='' it's a specific property of form element
<form id='' action=''>
<input name='' type=''>
</form>
